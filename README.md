# compose_multiplatform

This project shows how to use kotlin multiplatform with compose and custom ui components for each platform

* `/shared` is for code that will be shared across the Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
    - `commonMain` is for code that’s common for all targets.
    - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
      For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
      `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/android` contains the Android application
* `/ios` contains the iOS application. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.
